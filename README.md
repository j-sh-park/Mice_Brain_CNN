# Image Classifier Using Convolutional Neural Network on Cell Morphology

**Group:** Image7

This was completed as part of our DATA3888 Capstone project. This github contains the history and updates of our process in training the CNN model (based on the alexnet architecture) and Random Forest, as well as the development of our Shiny App that served as our deliverables for the project.

The aim of our project is to determine the impact of preprocessing techniques on the training dataset that is fed into the deep learning model, on the deep learning model's accuracy.

We used the following preprocessing techniques:
- No boundaries & no techniques 
- Just boundaries
- Denoise
- Thresholding
- Opening
- Power Law
